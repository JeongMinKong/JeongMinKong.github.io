RIS consists of many passive elements that behave like antennas, and each of these small elements are able to execute distinct capabilities that metasurface possesses, like manipulate phase, wavelength, power, and angle of the reflecting signals. Such unique abilities of RIS will make it possible to control the signal propagation environment for the first time ever, and this groundbreaking technology is expected to improve and resolve many of the problems facing today’s 4G and 5G communication systems, especially the bandwidth and energy efficiency issues, which are projected to worsen at an accelerating rate due to the rapid advancements of technologies like IoT and autonomous vehicles. Given this powerful tool, it becomes extremely important to ask: where should they be placed, and what should their configurations be such that received power and SNR are maximized? Using recently published RIS channel model as the basis, we have developed an RIS-assisted communication simulation software (with GUI) which allows researchers to design and examine diverse simulation environments that satisfy the constraints of their RIS-associated research problem. By conducting many simulations under various appropriate settings, optimal number of RISs, position and plane of the RISs, and configurations of the RISs (ex. size, element number, gain, etc) that maximizes the received power and SNR can be determined. <strong> Latest simulation results were discussed at IEEE PIMRC 2020 RIS Tutorial and IEEE Globecom 2020 RIS Tutorial</strong>. </span> </p> </td>

Over the past few months, there have been many published papers that outline the improvement in SNR at the receiver through the deployment of UAVs and IRSs, but even though these studies showed outstanding results, they did not account for the interference signals coming from the transmitters in the adjacent cells, and thus the SINR, which is a more accurate performance measurement. We developed a more realistic UAV, IRS, as well as UAV & IRS integrated communication simulation program that considers the presence of multiple cell towers, UAV transmitters, user terminals, and ground-based IRSs in a group of Voronoi cells, to ultimately examine how SINR at each cell tower vary under diverse simulation conditions. Together with machine learning, this simulation program will be used to tackle various optimization problems. <strong> Project report is available upon request</strong>. </span> </p> </td>

From the efficiency view, GAGG has been verified to be an excellent scintillation material candidate because it has very high density compared to the formerly used materials such as NaI and CsI. However, due to the lack of simulation programs available, it was previously very difficult to determine which GAGG scintillator design especially yield the best time resolution. We contributed in modelling the best time resolution GAGG scintillator design for future exotic nuclei experiments at RIBF Facility at RIKEN by developing an algorithm that is capable of accurately measuring the times of over 1 million photocathode-detected optical photons with the consideration of complex combinations of physics phenomena, successfully implementing it using GEANT4, and visualizing the results for time resolution measurements using ROOT. <strong> Project report is available upon request</strong>. </span> </p> </td>

We further contributed in better understanding this phenomenon by conducting simulations of various scenarios using the Python 4G/5G wireless coverage simulation program, and ultimately presenting new mathematical relationships between the shape and scale parameters of the Gamma pdf and the simulation parameters. <strong> Presented the results to the Principal Technology Architect from TELUS</strong>. <strong> Project report is available upon request</strong>. </span> </p> <p style = "font-size: 2.4vmin; padding-left: 2vw; color: #E13A29;"> <strong> 5G (mmWave) Wireless Coverage Simulation Software for Efficient Network Planning</strong> <br> <span style = "font-size: 1.8vmin; color: #5D5B5B;"> 5G promises to make communication extremely fast, and one way it aims to accomplish this is by utilizing the mmWave spectrum. Researchers are currently working on solving many problems surrounding the mmWave concept, one being signals not being able to propagate long distances due to their high-attenuation property. One possible way to solve this issue is by having short relay hops, but without careful planning, this method could become very costly as it requires many transceivers. We helped researchers at TELUS  develop efficient mmWave transceiver placement plans by building them a mmWave wireless coverage design & analysis simulation software program with GUI using Python. <strong> Project report is available upon request</strong>. </span> </p> </td>
